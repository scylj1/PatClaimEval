A method of manufacturing an article of footwear, comprising: forming an upper of the article of footwear by depositing thermoplastic elastomer materials using a solid deposition modeling technique, wherein the upper is formed in a layered structure comprising at least two layers that are fuse bonded together; and engaging the upper with a sole structure, wherein the sole structure is selected from the group consisting of a midsole, a midsole and an outsole engaged with the midsole, and a midsole and an outsole integrally formed as a single piece.  2. The method of claim 1, wherein the sole structure further comprises at least one of: a fluid-filled bladder; and a polymer foam material.  3. The method of claim 1 or claim 2, wherein forming the upper comprises: forming a plurality of upper portions using the solid deposition modeling technique; and joining together the plurality of upper portions using at least one of stitching and adhesively bonding.  4. The method of any one of claims 1 to 3, wherein forming the upper further comprises forming a texture along at least a portion of the upper using the solid deposition modeling technique.  5. The method of any one of claims 1 to 4, further comprising forming the upper according to a user-customized three-dimensional design specified in a design file, wherein at least one dimension of the upper specified in the design file corresponds to data derived from a scan of a user's foot.  6. The method of any one of claims 1 to 5, wherein engaging the upper with the sole structure includes at least one of: stitching at least a portion of the upper to at least a portion of the sole structure; and adhesively bonding at least a portion of the upper to at least a portion of the sole structure.  7. The method of claim 2, wherein the sole structure includes a fluid-filled bladder disposed in a void formed within the midsole.  8. The method of any one of claims 1 to 7, wherein forming the upper includes forming a plurality of apertures in one or more portions of the upper using the solid deposition modeling technique.  9. The method of claim 8, wherein the plurality of apertures are formed in a repeating pattern or in a non-repeating pattern.  10. The method of any one of claims 1 to 9, further comprising forming a comfort enhancing element using the solid deposition modeling technique.  11. The method of any one of claims 1 to 10, wherein forming the upper further comprises forming a logo region at a portion of the upper using the solid deposition modeling technique.  12. An article of footwear produced by the method of any one of claims 1 to 11.  ",
